This component is assumed to continue smoothly but is also assumed to be stationary so its distribution will return to the prior.
The prior distribution places mass on smooth functions with a marginal mean of zero and a typical lengthscale of 3.1 weeks.
[This is a placeholder for a description of how quickly the posterior will start to resemble the prior].
